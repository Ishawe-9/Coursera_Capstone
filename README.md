# Coursera Capstone Project

# Introduction
As an international student who wants to study in the US, I have made the choice of studying in either Harvard or Yale University. The two universities are both prestigious; as they are part of the Ivy League universities and both offer my desired course choice which is data science. However, in all of these, what will influence my final choice of the university to attend between these two will be the numbers of data science hubs, research centers and data science businesses located around the school to cater for summer work and internship. I believe this project will also be of importance and guide students who want to study in any of these schools as they can use it select their choice of school based on the criteria mentioned above.

# Data Description
The data used will be sourced from Foursquare location data of the area surrounding Harvard University and Yale University. The data will be analyzed using Jupyter Python Notebook with libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Folium and a whole lot of other libraries.
